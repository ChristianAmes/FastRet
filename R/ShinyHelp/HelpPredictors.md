# Predictor selection 

Here you can defined how your predcitor dataset should look like. 
Principle Predictors can be added by CDK [1] or via the HMDB [2] database. Keep in mind that predictors that have zero to none variance are excluded before training the regression model.

## Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) 

This option calculates 291 precitors by using the R-Wrapper package RCDK [3]. For this option you need to provide SMILES with your data. 
For further details about this predictor set, see:

## Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) 

The HMDB provides a wide variety of information for metabolomic researchers, this software utilizes the provided predicted molecular properties. For this option you need to provide the HMDB ID's with your data.
